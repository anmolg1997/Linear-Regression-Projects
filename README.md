# Linear-Regression-Projects
sales prediction using the TV marketing budget to build a simple linear regression model. 
We will have three variables to deal with. The marketing budget will be split into three marketing channels: TV marketing, radio marketing and newspaper marketing.

Problem Statement:
Build a model which predicts sales based on the money spent on different platforms for marketing.

Data:
Use the advertising dataset given.

Model:
1. Analyse the relationship between 'TV advertising' and 'sales' using a simple linear regression model. We'll build a linear regression model to predict Sales using an appropriate predictor variable.
